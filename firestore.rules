/**
 * This Firestore Security Ruleset enforces a security model where all authenticated users can read
 * all reports, but can only write, update, or delete their own data.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * The security model is designed to be collaborative for reading data but strict for modifications.
 * Authorization for write operations is based on the user's authenticated UID.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Private user profile data.
 * - /layouts/{layoutId}: Stores versioned layouts. `config` doc holds current version.
 * - /reports/{reportId}: Individual report documents, containing a `userId` field for ownership. This collection
 *   is readable by all signed-in users, but writable only by the owner or an admin.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Admin Override: A designated admin user can edit or delete any report and any layout.
 * - Public Report Data: The `reports` collection is readable by any signed-in user.
 * - Public Layout Data: The `layouts` collection is readable by any signed-in user, but writable only by an admin.
 * - User Listing Disabled: To protect user privacy, listing top-level collections like `users` is disabled.
 * - Path-Based and Field-Based Security: Authorization for `users` relies on matching `request.auth.uid`
 *   with the document ID. For `reports`, write authorization relies on matching `request.auth.uid` with the `userId` field inside
 *   the document or checking for admin status.
