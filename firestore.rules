/**
 * This Firestore Security Ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for a form management application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * The security model is designed to be highly secure and performant by ensuring that users can only access data
 * within their own dedicated data tree or documents they own. Authorization is based on the user's authenticated UID.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Private user profile data.
 * - /layouts/{userId}: User-specific layout configurations.
 * - /reports/{reportId}: Individual report documents, containing a `userId` field for ownership. This collection
 *   requires a composite index on (userId, vehicleId) to allow for efficient and secure user-specific searches.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - No Public Data: There are no globally readable collections.
 * - User Listing Disabled: To protect user privacy, listing top-level collections is disabled.
 * - Path-Based and Field-Based Security: Authorization for `users` and `layouts` relies on matching `request.auth.uid`
 *   with the document ID. For `reports`, it relies on matching `request.auth.uid` with the `userId` field inside
 *   the document, allowing for queries.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * The `reports` collection is denormalized. Instead of nesting reports under a user, they are in a top-level
 * collection with a `userId` field. This is crucial for allowing users to query their own reports (e.g., by vehicleId)
 * without violating security rules, which would be impossible if they were in a nested subcollection that required
 * wildcard reads.
