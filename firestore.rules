/**
 * This Firestore Security Ruleset enforces a security model where all authenticated users can read
 * all reports and layouts. Any authenticated user can update any report, but only admins can
 * manage layouts.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * The security model is designed to be highly collaborative. Reading is open to all signed-in users.
 * Report updates are also open to all signed-in users to allow for multi-user editing workflows.
 * Layout modifications are a privileged action, restricted to admins.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Private user profile data. Only the owner can manage.
 * - /layouts/{layoutId}: Stores versioned layouts. Readable by all, writable only by an admin.
 * - /reports/{reportId}: Individual report documents. Readable and writable by all signed-in users, but can only be
 *   created by a user setting themselves as the owner.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Admin Override: A designated admin user can edit or delete any report and any layout.
 * - Public Report Data: The `reports` collection is readable by any signed-in user.
 * - Public Layout Data: The `layouts` collection is readable by any signed-in user, but writable only by an admin.
 * - Collaborative Report Editing: Any signed-in user can update any report.
 * - User Listing Disabled: To protect user privacy, listing top-level collections like `users` is disabled.
